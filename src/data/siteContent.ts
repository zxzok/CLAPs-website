export const paperAbstract = `Many real-world complex systems can be modeled as multiplex networks, where each layer represents a distinct set of interactions among the same entities. This paper formulates the minimum-union problem for matching-based structural controllability in duplex networks: under fixed layer-wise minimum driver budgets, find the smallest union of driver nodes that makes both layers structurally controllable. The proposed Shortest Cross-Layer Augmenting Path Search (CLAP-S) algorithm reconfigures layer-wise maximum matchings to increase driver overlap while preserving each layer's budget. The paper proves that each successful CLAP update reduces the difference mass by exactly 2, that the union size drops by 1 accordingly, and that the absence of any CLAP certifies global optimality within the fixed-budget feasible space. Experiments on synthetic and real-world duplex networks show that CLAP-S matches exact ILP solutions and significantly outperforms random sampling baselines, while CLAP-G offers a faster greedy tradeoff.`;
